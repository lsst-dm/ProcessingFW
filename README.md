This code is part of the Dark Enery Survey (DES) Data Management System (DESDM).
DESDM's mission is to process the raw data generated by the DECAM instrument at the 
CTIO observatory into science-ready data products.   The DESDM system is used for the 
processing and calibration of the DES data.   In addition to managing processing jobs, the 
DESDM system also includes data management items such as metadata and provenance.
